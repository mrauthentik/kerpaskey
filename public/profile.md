Name: Uchenna Umoke
Profession: Full Stack Developer
PROFILE
Full-Stack Engineer with experience building scalable, production-ready web applications using modern 
frontend frameworks and backend technologies. I’ve worked across education and SaaS platforms, delivering 
reliable systems with clean architecture, pixel-perfect interfaces, and smooth, intuitive user flows.
I take ownership of problems end-to-end, from understanding product requirements to implementing, 
refining, and maintaining solutions. My background in teaching programming has strengthened my 
engineering approach: I write clear, maintainable code, communicate effectively, and think carefully about 
both developer and user experience.
I work comfortably in remote, distributed teams and enjoy collaborating with people who value quality, 
continuous improvement, and practical, well-engineered solutions.
